**The Hottest Topics in Machine Learning**
---
The **NIPS conference (Neural Information Processing Systems)** is one of the most prestigious yearly events in the machine learning community. 
At each NIPS conference, a large number of research papers are published. 
Over 50,000 PDF files were automatically downloaded and processed to obtain a dataset on various machine learning techniques. 
These NIPS papers are stored in <code>datasets/papers.csv</code>. 

The CSV file contains information on the different NIPS papers that were published from 1987 until 2017 (30 years!). 

These papers discuss a wide variety of topics in machine learning, from neural networks to optimization methods and many more.

<p>Machine learning has become increasingly popular over the past years. The number of NIPS conference papers has risen exponentially, and people are continuously looking for ways on how they can incorporate machine learning into their products and services.</p>
<p>Although this analysis focused on analyzing machine learning trends in research, a lot of these techniques are rapidly being adopted in industry. 
   Following the latest machine learning trends is a critical skill for a data scientist, and it is recommended to continuously keep learning by going through blogs, tutorials, and courses.</p>
